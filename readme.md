#Pasta

A collection of functions that I have found myself copy pastaing around.

This is a personal utility library, maintained as a single repo and package
for the sake of convenience. Individual functions are intended to be
required out like `var log = require('pasta/log')`. Plain `require('pasta')`
includes all utilities, and is only intended for interactive use and debugging.
Tests and documentation live along side each utility.

Some of the utilities I build on and use most commonly are re-exposed from
pasta, and some of my more generally useful utilities are also published
under their own names.
